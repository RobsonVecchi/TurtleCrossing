# Turtle Crossing Game

This is a simple game created with the `turtle` module where a player controls a turtle that must navigate across a screen filled with moving cars. The goal is to cross the finish line without colliding with any cars. The game increases in difficulty as the player progresses.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main game loop that handles game logic and interactions.
- `player.py`: Defines the `Player` class that controls the turtle and player interactions.
- `car_manager.py`: Manages car creation, movement, and level-up functionality.
- `scoreboard.py`: Handles the display of the player's score and game-over conditions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository;
 2. Install Dependencies (Ensure you have Python installed. `turtle` is included with the standard Python library, so no additional installations are needed.); 
3. Run the Game (Navigate to the project directory and run the `main.py` file).

## Controls

- **Up Arrow**: Move the player turtle up the screen.
